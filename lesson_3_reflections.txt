When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if you want to do local work against static local files and pull in changes when you are ready for them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are only on Github, this is a way of copying a repository to your origin.
Clones are a way to copy a repository. From gethub to local or local to local.
Branches are a way to diverge your revision change. So you can add commits that are independent of the master branch.
