How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help me see the bug that was introduced?

We new the bug was in the changes so diff isolated the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file may you a more efficient programmer in the long term? 

If a bug is introduced it could help us understand when it got in the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: You can choose the extent of a functional/logic change.
Cons: You may screw up and forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

With code changes in multiple files are often interdependent. Not so much with documents, usually.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

The log shows a history of commits. Diff can be used to see the content or changes associated with each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Well you can get back to where you were assuming you find the bug before releaseing it.
