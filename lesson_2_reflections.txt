What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It turns the current directory into a repository. Specifically, a .git directory is created with all the guts.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is part of git and not under user control other than via git commands. It allows to specifically pick files from the working directory to be commited.
